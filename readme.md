## Gunfig: A menu API for modded Gungeon

### For Modders:

Downloaded the latest Gunfig API dll [from GitHub](https://github.com/pcrain/Gunfig/releases) or [from Thunderstore](https://enter-the-gungeon.thunderstore.io/package/CaptainPretzel/Gunfig/), and add it as a reference in your project. See the [API Documentation](https://github.com/pcrain/Gunfig/blob/master/src/Gunfig/GunfigAPI.cs) and [Example Configuration](https://github.com/pcrain/Gunfig/blob/master/src/DefaultConfigs/QoLConfig.cs) to get started!

### For Players:

If you're using a mod manager, any mod that requires Gunfig should automatically download it for you. You may also download Gunfig as a standalone mod, as it comes with options for enabling several quality-of-life changes, including:

  + auto-firing for semi-automatic weapons
  + selectable co-op characters
  + improved menu / co-op quick start
  + static camera while aiming
  + show enemy health bars
  + show enemy damage numbers
  + better menu sounds (e.g., when toggling options or changing sliders)
